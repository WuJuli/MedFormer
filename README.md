## Results
### 2D Synapse Dataset
State-of-the art comparison on the abdominal multi-organ Synapse dataset for 2D methods. For all models the model complexity and the performance (DSC, HD95) is shown. The proposed 2D D-LKA Net achieves superior segmentation performance. Abbreviations stand for: Spl: _spleen_, RKid: _right kidney_, LKid: _left kidney_, Gal: _gallbladder_, Liv: _liver_, Sto: _stomach_, Aor: _aorta_, Pan: _pancreas_. Best results are shown in <h style="color:blue;">blue</h>, second best in <h style="color:red;">red</h>.

### 3D Synapse Dataset
State-of-the art comparison on the abdominal multi-organ Synapse dataset for 3D methods. For all models the model complexity and the performance (DSC, HD95) is shown. The proposed 3D D-LKA Net achieves superior segmentation performance. Our models also is considerably small with the lowest number of parameters. Abbreviations stand for: Spl: _spleen_, RKid: _right kidney_, LKid: _left kidney_, Gal: _gallbladder_, Liv: _liver_, Sto: _stomach_, Aor: _aorta_, Pan: _pancreas_. Best results are shown in <h style="color:blue;">blue</h>, second best in <h style="color:red;">red</h>.

### Qualitative Results
While the 2D version achieves great segmentation results in comparison to other 2D models, the main limitation is the lack of inter-slice connections. Here, the 3D models achieves favorable segmentations.
